# BETTER SKILL XP
* The mod rework the way skill points are earned for Mending, Cooking, Fire Starting & Gunsmithing skills
* Skills points are earned based on (tweakable) **time spent** doing stuff
* Therefore you still learn something even when you fail *(except for cooking skill)*

## SETTINGS
### MENDING
* You earn skill points based on time spent **using a sewing kit** (or fishing line)
* Applied to **any kind of repair or crafting** with sewing kit
### COOKING
* You earn skill points based on time spent prepping & cooking (base values)
* You can set a penalty for cooking with recycled cans or directly over the fire
* You can set an incremental bonus for actual recipes based on their required level
### FIRE STARTING
* You earn skill points based on time spent starting time (base values)
* It means for instance you don't learn much if you start a fire with accelerant
### GUNSMITHING
* You earn skill points based on time spent : 
* **harvesting** items containing gunpowder
* **repairing gun items** 
* **Crafting** bullets, gunpowder and any item requiring gunpowder
* You can set a **penalty for harvesting** stuff (so it doesn't count as much as other gunsmithing activity)
* You can set a **bonus for repairing and/or crafting**
